# Motivation (Intro)
I bet many of you already heard about cryptocurrencies given the huge increase in interest over the past few years. We, at Badi, started playing around investing in some coins just this year and rapidly got hooked.

Since this is a very volatile market with high fluctuating prices, investing means taking some risks. And this is why we often see ourselves checking out growth charts and internet forums such as reddit among others. Knowing how other people actually perceive the coin helps you a lot when it comes to investing.
